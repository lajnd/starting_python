    "Maybe some of you have some experience with Python from previous courses, however, here we will start by assuming no previous knowledge. Learning how to program is mostly learning how to define and find solutions for your problems. There are a lot of great online sources for programming problem shooting (such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)), which you'll notice will be of great use for you in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, you'll have to have Python 3, with the following packages:\n",
    "- numpy (for arrays and matrices)\n",
    "- pandas (for loading, handling and saving data)\n",
    "- seaborn / matplot lib (for plotting)\n",
    "- scipy (for basic statistics)\n",
    "- scikit learn (for regression models and machine learning)\n",
    "- Jupyter (for running your scripts and view plots)\n",

    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Lifted from pythons official website:](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.\n"

    "If you can stand the horrible resolution and music, you could check out [this video](https://youtu.be/H6dLGQw9yFQ) (they use the old name, 'IPython Notebook'), or you could look at the written explanation below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, you are using the web-browser as a kind of editor from which you can run python code, similar to the MATLAB interactive editor or RStudio. The cool thing about these notebooks is that they allow you to mix code \"cells\" (see below) and text \"cells\" (such as this one). The (printed) output from code blocks are displayed right below the code blocks themselves. \n",

    "- Command mode is indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin (as is the case now!): When you are in command mode, you are able to edit the notebook as a whole, but not type into individual cells. Most importantly, in command mode, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts that let you perform notebook and cell actions efficiently (some shortcuts in command mode will be discussed later!). Enter command mode by pressing Esc or using the mouse to click outside a cell’s editor area; <br><br>\n",
    "- Edit mode is indicated by a green cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area: When a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor. Enter edit mode by pressing Enter or using the mouse to double-click on a cell’s editor area.\n",

    "* the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) package provides plotting functions;\n",
    "* and various specialied neuroimaging packages provide functionality to work and analyze (f)MRI (e.g. [nibabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel/) and [nipype](http://nipy.org/nipype)) and MEG/EEG (e.g. [MNE](http://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html)).\n",
