    "### Non-parametric testing\n",
    "Lets steal some text from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics): *Unlike parametric statistics, nonparametric statistics make no assumptions about the probability distributions of the variables being assessed. The difference between parametric models and non-parametric models is that the former has a fixed number of parameters, while the latter grows the number of parameters with the amount of training data. Note that the non-parametric model does, counterintuitively, contain parameters: the distinction is that parameters are determined by the training data in the case of non-parametric statistics, not the model.* \n",
    "\n",
    "One very useful nonparametric test is the permutation test. Here we estimate a null distribution by randomly shuffle our observed values, create two new groups based on the shuffled data and save the differences between these groups. If our observed differences is better than 95% of our null distribution, we say that we have a significant difference. It is very easy to implement your own permutation test, see below for an example:"
